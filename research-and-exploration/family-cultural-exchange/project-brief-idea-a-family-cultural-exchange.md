# Project Brief — Idea A: Family Cultural Exchange for Kids

Session purpose: Early-stage BMAD-guided brief to clarify whether to advance to a PRD. Scope: Idea A only.

## Problem Framing
- Preliminary POV: Traveling families want meaningful, safe, age-appropriate cultural connections for kids aged 5–15; local families want to share their culture with peers in a structured, values-aligned way.

## Target Users
- Visiting parents (payers) with children aged 5–15 seeking real local culture beyond tourism.
- Local parents with children aged 5–15 who enjoy sharing culture and want structured, safe exchange.

## Current Inputs (Q&A Log)
1) Primary user persona (age range, context, motivation)?
   - Ages 5–15; visiting parents are decision-makers/payers aiming for meaningful, safe, human connection and cultural exposure; locals want to share culture, build pride, practice language, and give their kids global awareness.
2) Single most important outcome for visiting parents?
   - Empathy through real human connection. Kids feel local life by forming genuine, age-appropriate relationships with a local child/family; culture is lived and human, not touristic or performative.
3) Single most important outcome for local parents?
   - Empathy and global awareness via genuine connection with visiting kids; cultural difference felt as human and equal, not abstract or hierarchical.
4) What “proof moments” do visiting parents imagine?
   - Relaxed social time with a local child/family (shared meal, park visit, cultural outing).
   - Fun activities the local family naturally does, not staged or instructional.
   - Child interacts comfortably despite language/cultural differences.
   - Child later refers to them as “my friend,” not “someone we met.”
   - Post-visit curiosity/empathy: asks questions, makes comparisons, shows interest in another way of life.
5) What “proof moments” do local parents imagine?
   - Child forms a real peer connection (plays naturally, laughs, no adult forcing).
   - Curiosity/openess toward difference versus shyness/superiority.
   - Refers to visiting child as a friend, not “the tourist.”
   - Asks about the visitor’s life (school, home, language, food).
   - Expresses empathy/perspective-taking (“They do things differently/that would be hard/fun”).
   - Feels comfortable hosting/sharing without feeling on display or judged.
6) Top risks/blockers for visiting parents (ranked)
   1. Child safety & trust with unfamiliar families.
   2. Logistics/scheduling friction while traveling (timing, location, energy).
   3. Social awkwardness or mismatch; fear it feels forced.
   4. Language barriers; kids may struggle to communicate naturally.
   5. Unclear value vs. effort; fear it won’t feel different from tourist activities.
7) Top risks/blockers for local parents (ranked)
   1. Child safety & trust with unfamiliar visiting families (supervision, values, boundaries).
   2. Time/scheduling friction within full routines (school, activities, family time).
   3. Social awkwardness/mismatch; fear kids or parents won’t connect naturally.
   4. Language barriers leading to shyness/being left out.
   5. Emotional/energy cost vs payoff; uncertain the effort yields meaningful benefit.
8) Initial pilot destinations/locales & rationale
   - Criteria: high inbound US family travel volume; family-friendly/safe/walkable; strong everyday cultural life (parks/cafes/markets/public spaces) enabling natural interactions; established local family communities (including expat/bilingual) to ease trust/communication; density over sprawl for easier matching.
   - Illustrative cities: Barcelona, Paris, London, Rome, Florence (high US family visitation, strong public life, cultural richness, family travel infrastructure).
9) Minimum viable exchange format (v1)
   - Duration: 60–90 minutes; enough for kids to relax/connect, short enough to avoid fatigue/awkwardness.
   - Location: Neutral, public, family-friendly space (park/playground/pedestrian plaza/beach promenade/cafe with outdoor seating). No home visit required for v1.
   - Activity style: Light shared social activity—free play (ball/playground/simple game), casual parent conversation, optional small cultural element (snack, local game, short walk).
   - Structure: Loosely guided with clear start/end; light prompts from app; no formal agenda.
   - Safety defaults: Public setting, daylight, parent-present throughout.
   - Rationale: Minimizes risk, cost, and coordination while enabling real connection and memory without overcommitting either family.
10) Trust, safety, and screening signals (v1 essentials)
    - Verified parent identity: real name, photo, basic ID verification for all adult participants.
    - Child context transparency: ages, number of children attending, parent/guardian presence stated.
    - Clear family profile: short bio on who they are, why they’re participating, and exchange preferences.
    - Public-meeting default: first meeting in public, family-friendly location, daylight hours.
    - In-app messaging only pre-meet; no off-platform contact until both confirm.
    - Post-exchange feedback loop: simple private “felt safe / would meet again” (no public stars).
    - Explicitly avoids: medical/background/criminal checks; public reviews; performance scoring—keeping it human, respectful, and low-friction.
11) Core value proposition (visiting parents)
    - “We help your child become a more empathetic, open-minded human by forming real friendships with children from other cultures—at the age when those experiences shape who they become.”
12) Core value proposition (local parents)
    - “We create safe, meaningful moments where your child connects with visiting kids and learns to understand the world beyond their own.”
13) Pilot success criteria (to decide on deeper investment, not full validation)
    - Clear parent pull (qual): visiting parents voice strong emotional value (empathy, confidence, global awareness) unprompted; language is “this matters for my child,” not “this was nice.”
    - Low-friction participation: families complete exchanges with minimal coordination/confusion; no major drop-off from logistics, awkwardness, or unclear expectations.
    - Child-level signal: kids describe the other family as a relationship (“my friend”); show curiosity/reflection after the exchange.
    - Local family willingness: locals want to host again/recommend; motivation stays values-driven (connection/empathy), not transactional.
    - Decision clarity: post-pilot we can answer, “Is this a real, repeatable need — and does Cerca uniquely solve it?”
14) v1 guardrails & constraints (quality + comfort essentials)
    - Parent-present always; no unsupervised child interactions.
    - Home visits only if both parents are present and explicitly opt in; no pressure to host—public/semi-public options always available.
    - One family ↔ one family only (no group meetups) to keep it intimate/manageable.
    - Clear expectations agreed in advance: location type, duration range, child ages, language comfort, activity style.
    - Social interactions only; not daily routines (no school runs/chores/bedtime).
    - Geographic proximity limits to reduce logistical strain and cancellations.
15) v1 critical matching criteria (hard filters)
    - Child age compatibility: within ~±2–3 years for natural interaction/play styles.
    - Geographic proximity: practical local radius to minimize logistics/fatigue/drop-off.
    - Timing overlap: pre-agreed availability windows (date + rough time block) to reduce coordination friction.
    - Language comfort: at least one shared language between parents at basic conversational level; kids can be mixed-language.
    - Family structure expectations: align on group size, parent presence, home-visit acceptability.
    - Activity comfort profile: high-level preference match (outdoor play / quiet social / food-centered / cultural outing).
16) Explicitly out of scope for v1
    - Activities excluded: no everyday routine participation (school days, babysitting, drop-offs, homework, childcare); no unsupervised child-only meetups.
    - Monetization excluded: no income/payment to local families as core incentive; no marketplace-style pricing competition.
    - Formats excluded: no large-scale/anonymous matching that removes family context; no replacement of schools, camps, or formal education programs.
    - Purpose: keep peer-to-peer family connection central; maintain safety/trust/parent presence; avoid over-structuring or institutionalizing; preserve flexibility with quality.
17) Pilot proof moments & signals (what/how)
    - Parent pull (visiting): prompt 24–48h post-exchange—“Would you do this again here?” (Yes/Probably/No + why); “Would you invite a friend traveling here?” (Yes/Maybe/No).
    - Child connection: parent reflection—“What did your child say afterward?” (free text); checklist of observed behaviors (asked about how other kids live, respectful comparisons, wants to see them again).
    - Local willingness: follow-up—“Would you host/meet another visiting family?” (Yes/Maybe/No); “What did your child gain?” (free text/empathy options).
    - Trust/comfort validation: both sides—“Did you ever feel unsure or uncomfortable?” (No/Briefly/Yes + note); implicit signal if they continue participating without reducing profile visibility.
18) Non-negotiable brand/experience principles
    - Child-first, human-first: emotional comfort, safety, and agency for kids over novelty/content/convenience.
    - Peer families, not hosts/guests: equal exchange, not hospitality/entertainment/service; no one “performs” culture.
    - Genuine connection over activity: success is real interaction/relationship, not places visited/photos taken.
    - Trust before scale: fewer high-trust exchanges over rapid growth; safety, consent, comfort first.
    - Culture as lived, not displayed: no staged traditions/costumes/performances; culture shared naturally through time together.
19) Open market/viability questions (not resolved here)
    - Willingness to pay: realistic price per exchange; variation by destination/child age.
    - Pricing model sensitivity: per-exchange vs. family pass/credit; psychological ceiling.
    - Seasonality & supply balance: demand across holidays/summer/off-season; local availability pacing.
    - Activation friction: tolerated steps before drop-off (screening/messaging/scheduling).
    - Repeat usage potential: one-off trip enhancer vs. multiple exchanges per trip/across trips.
20) Key assumptions/risks to validate next (beyond trust/safety) & learning approach
    - Parents prioritize this over other travel activities: concierge pilot with real traveling families; track follow-through vs. drop-off post-interest.
    - Local families participate without financial incentives: recruit for concierge matches; observe willingness to host, repeat, and refer.
    - Short format feels “worth it”: shadow 60–120 minute exchanges + post-meet interviews; ask if they’d do it again and why.
    - Matching criteria drive quality: vary age/language/proximity/timing in concierge matches; compare outcomes and friction.
    - Parents’ language aligns to empathy/connection: intercept and follow-up interviews; capture exact phrasing parents use.
    - Learning approach: concierge-led pilot (manual matching/coordination), short post-exchange interviews (10–15m), light observation/shadowing; no automation/monetization/scaling assumptions yet.
